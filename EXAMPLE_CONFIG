# Stellar mesh improvement options #
####################################

# This file contains all the possible options that can currently be set for 
# mesh improvement. Lines that begin with '#' are comments and are ignored.
# Other lines take the form 'option intval floatval stringval', where option
# is the name of the option, and intval floatval and stringval are the possible
# fields that can be used to set that option. If an option takes an int, only
# a value for int needs to be given. If it's a float, a dummy int should be
# inserted before the float. If it's a string, a dummy int and a dummy float
# should be inserted before the string. This clumsiness is because I don't like
# coding string processing in C, and this is the easiest way. Any unset options
# will assume their default values.

# verbosity: bigger number means more verbose output of improvement.
# default = 1
verbosity 0

# use color in verbose improvement output. default = 0
usecolor 1

# just output the mesh unchanged and quit. default = 0
outputandquit 0

## quality measure options
# qualmeasure: selects which quality measure to use as an objective function
# for optimizing the tetrahedra. The quality measures are described in
# Chapter 2 of Bryan's dissertation. default = 0
# 0 = minimum sine of the dihedral angles (default)
# 1 = square root of radius ratio (circumradius divided by inradius)
# 2 = V / l_rms^3 (volume divided by cube of root-mean-squared edge length)
# 5 = minimum sine with biased obtuse angles
qualmeasure 5

# sinewarpfactor: float. for qualmeasure 5 only; sets the factor by which
# obtuse angles are scaled relative to acute angles. Default is 0.75
sinewarpfactor 0 0.75

## termination options
# BOTH goal angles must be reached to terminate improvement
# goalanglemin: float. terminates improvement early if minimum angle reaches
# this value. default = 90.0 (which precludes early termination)
goalanglemin 0 90.0
# goalanglemax: float. terminates improvement early if maximum angle reaches
# this value. default = 90.0
goalanglemax 0 90.0

## smoothing options
# nonsmooth: enable optimization-based smoothing. default = 1
nonsmooth 1
# facetsmooth: enable smoothing of facet vertices. default = 1
facetsmooth 1
# segmentsmooth: enable smoothing of segment vertices. default = 1
segmentsmooth 1
# usequadrics: enable use of surface quadric error for smoothing fixed boundary
# vertices. WARNING: this will allow the domain shape to change slightly.  But
# even a little play sometimes yields much better meshes. default = 0
usequadrics 0
# quadricoffset: amount to start quadric error at before subtracting.
# See alpha in Section 3.2.5 of Bryan's dissertation. default = 0.8
quadricoffset 0 0.8
# quadricscale: amount to scale quadric error before subtracting from offset.
# See beta in Section 3.2.5 of Bryan's dissertation. default = 300.0
quadricscale 0 300.0

## topological transformation options
# flip22: enable 2-2 flips (for boundary tets). default = 1
flip22 1
# multifaceremoval: enable multi-face removal. singlefaceremoval might still
# be on. default = 1
multifaceremoval 1
# singlefaceremoval: enable single face removal (2-3 and 2-2 flips). Has
# no effect when multifaceremoval is enabled. default = 1
singlefaceremoval 1
# edgeremoval: enable edge removal. default = 1
edgeremoval 1

## edge contraction options
# edgecontraction: enable edge contraction. default = 1
edgecontraction 1

## vertex insertion options
# enableinsert: enable ALL vertex insertion (overrides others). default = 1
enableinsert 1
# insertbody: enable just vertex insertion in body (interior). default = 1
insertbody 1
# insertfacet: enable just insertion on facets. default = 1
insertfacet 1
# insertsegment: enable just insertion on segments. default = 1
insertsegment 1
# insertthreshold: on each insertion pass, try vertex insertion in this
fraction of the tetrahedra. default = 0.031 (the worst 3.1%)
insertthreshold 0 0.031

## size control options
# (See Chapter 6 of Bryan's dissertation.)
# sizing: enable control of element sizes. default = 0
sizing 0
# sizingpass: enable edge length correction before quality improvement.
# default = 0
sizingpass 0
# targetedgelength: the target edge length for this mesh. If set to 0.0, the
# target edge length is initialized automatically to the initial mean edge
# length. default = 0.0
targetedgelength 0 0.0
# longerfactor: factor by which an edge can be longer than the target edge
# length before being considered "too long". default = 3.0
longerfactor 0 2.0
# shorterfactor: factor by which an edge can be shorter than the target edge
# length before being considered "too short" default = 0.33
shorterfactor 0 0.50

## anisotropy options
# (See Chapter 7 of Bryan's dissertation.)
# anisotropic: enable anisotropic meshing. default = 0
anisotropic 0
# tensor: which size/anisotropy tensor to use. default = 0
# 0 = identity
# 1 = stretch x
# 2 = stretch y
# 3 = sink
# 4 = swirl
# 5 = center
# 6 = perimeter
# 7 = right
# 8 = sine
tensor 6

## quality file output options
# These files list, for each tetrahedron, the values of the quality measures
# minsineout: enable output of .minsine quality file. default = 1
minsineout 1
# minangout: enable output of .minang quality file. default = 0
minangout 0

# vlrmsout: enable output of .vlrms quality file. default = 0
vlrmsout 0
# nrrout: enable output of the .nrr quality file. default = 0
nrrout 0

## animation options
# animate: activate animation file output (a set of output files after each
# pass). default = 0
animate 0
# timeseries: when animate = 1, only output .stats. default = 0
timeseries 0

## output filename option
# fileprefix: filename prefix that distinguishes the output files from the
# input files. If none specified, an iteration number is appended to the input
# filenames.
#fileprefix 0 5 ../output/testprefix
